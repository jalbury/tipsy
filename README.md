# Tipsy
Tipsy is a bartender simulator game for the Oculus Go, developed in Unity. In each level, customers come into your bar and order various types of drinks (shots, mixed drinks, draft beer, and bottled beer) and your score is based on the accuracy and timeliness of their order. It was developed in a team of three: [Jordan Albury](https://github.com/jalbury), [Matthew Bonsignore](https://github.com/MrMatt7), and [Jonathan Havener](https://github.com/Jonathan-Havener). Gameplay can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBOwC9BkI0U) (the video has some lag in it due to the gameplay being streamed over wifi from the headset, but this lag is not in the actual game). Tipsy is currently in the process of being submitted as a free app on the Oculus Go store.

## Getting Started
If you would like to contribute, the Unity project is included in the `Tipsy/` directory. This can be opened directly in Unity, but many of the prefabs will be missing because we cannot include some of the 3rd party asset packs here. To actually build the project, you'll first need to purchase and include the 3rd party asset packs we used, which are available in the Unity Asset Store here:
- [9t5 Low Poly Pub Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/9t5-low-poly-pub-pack-129977)
- [Low Poly Business People](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/low-poly-business-people-130313)

## Building and Running the Project
[This article](https://medium.com/inborn-experience/how-to-build-an-app-for-the-oculus-go-from-start-to-finish-with-unity-cb72d931ddae) has a good description of how to configure your Unity environment to build for the Oculus Go. Once you've set this up and have included the necessary 3rd party packages, you're ready to build and deploy to your Oculus Go!
